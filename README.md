# Mining with agents

This exercise contains the develop of some utilitarian agents in a mining environment. A society can be homogeneous or heterogeneous

## Things that could be done better
- Flexibility: 
	- Maximization Problem -> Linear Programming instead of equation
	- Should take the stance of a conservative agent => making the conditions with the minimum
- Heterogeneous and Homogeneous societies:
	- Maximization problem -> Linear Programming instead of permutations
